## 🤖 ASSISTANT (Simple Chatbot)

Assistant is a simple chatbot-style web project where users can interact by selecting predefined questions.
When a button is clicked, the assistant displays a typing effect and then responds with a related answer, creating a basic chat experience.
This project was created while I was in 8th grade as part of my learning process in JavaScript fundamentals, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous behavior.
